# Notice

This project uses `AGENTS.md` as the main context file for all AI agents (Claude Code and Gemini CLI).
Please refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for system architecture and instructions.

> **Note**: The automated scripts (`shutsujin_departure.sh`) automatically instruct agents to read `AGENTS.md`.
